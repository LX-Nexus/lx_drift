# 11.  Considerations for the Database Developer

**•Database File Location**: The databases (`user_emails.db and usage_data.db`) will reside in a lexi_db directory within the application's root. Ensure your implementation correctly references these paths.

**•Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for all database operations (e.g., try-except blocks for sqlite3.Error). This is crucial for maintaining application stability, especially when dealing with file I/O and potential database corruption.

**•Concurrency**: SQLite3 handles concurrency well for most typical application usage. However, if multiple parts of Lexi attempt to write to the same database simultaneously, consider using locking mechanisms or ensuring that database operations are sequential to prevent sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked errors. For read operations, multiple concurrent readers are fine.

**•Data Integrity**: Define appropriate NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints in your CREATE TABLE statements to ensure data quality. For example, email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE ensures that no two users have the same email address.

**•Schema Migrations**: As Lexi evolves, the database schema might need to change. Plan for future schema migrations using tools or custom scripts to alter tables without losing existing data. For initial development, simple DROP TABLE IF EXISTS followed by CREATE TABLE might suffice during testing, but this is not suitable for production.

**•Security**: While SQLite3 is local, be mindful of sensitive data. User emails should be handled with care. For the admin dashboard upload, ensure the communication channel is secure (HTTPS) and consider authentication/authorization for the upload endpoint.

**•Testing**: Thoroughly test all database interactions, including edge cases like empty databases, large datasets, and concurrent access scenarios.
